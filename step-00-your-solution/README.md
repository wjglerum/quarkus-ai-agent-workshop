# Step 0 – Your Workspace

Welcome!  
This is **your personal workspace** for the workshop.

**Stay in this folder** and do all your work here — you’ll gradually build your own solution step by step by writing and modifying code in this module.

Each numbered step in the repository (`step-01-introduction`, `step-02-chatbot`, etc.) contains explanations, hints, and reference implementations.  
You can open those for guidance — but **you don’t need to switch modules**.  
Everything you develop should live right here in `step-00-setup`.

## What to Do

1. Make sure the project builds and runs from this module.
2. Follow the instructions from the workshop facilitator or from the next step’s README to start coding.
3. Keep iterating here as you go through each step’s requirements.

## Continue Learning

Start reading the [Step 01 – Introduction](../step-01-introduction/README.md) for context and your first goal.

> Tip: You can copy or adapt code snippets from later steps as you progress; but try to implement each concept yourself first.
